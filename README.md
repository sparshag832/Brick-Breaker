# Brick-Breaker
Since childhood we were keen to play the brick breaker in out keypad phones , this is the time to enjoy it in our computer too.

I have used an array to keep track of how many times each brick has been hit, as well as to determine when there are no more bricks left on the board.

The goal is to eliminate all the bricks in each level by bouncing your ball off them.

This Brick Breaker Game is made in Java with Swing.

ENJOY THE GAME
